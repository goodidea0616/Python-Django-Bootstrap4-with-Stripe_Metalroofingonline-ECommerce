# metalroofingonline

 ## Getting Started
 ### Dependencies
 I suggest that venv is used to create a virtual environment in the project root folder.

 - Python
 - pip install from requirements-dev.txt

### Setup
Ask for the test DB file from enquiries@metalroofingonline.com.au
Place it inside the src/ folder

### Launch server
```
cd src/
python manage.py runserver
```
